                    Our built and natural heritage contributes to national health, wellbeing, enjoyment and sustainable
                    economic growth. The goal of the Department’s Heritage Division is to conserve and manage Ireland’s
                    unique heritage for the benefit of present and future generations, as a support to economic renewal
                    and
                    sustainable employment and in compliance with legal obligations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We work to ensure that Ireland has a suite of policies and legislation in place to meet modern
                    requirements and in compliance with EU and international heritage obligations. We also work to
                    achieve
                    effective implementation and, where appropriate, enforcement of heritage policies and legislation,
                    including through third parties.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In this way, we promote greater appreciation and understanding of the immense intrinsic value of
                    Ireland’s rich heritage and also as a valuable amenity for business, community development, farming
                    and
                    tourism and as a means of presenting Ireland as an attractive destination for sustainable inward
                    investment.
