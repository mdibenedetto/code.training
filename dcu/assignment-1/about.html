            The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht oversees the protection and presentation of Ireland’s
            heritage and cultural assets. Our goals are to promote and protect Ireland’s heritage and culture, to
            advance
            the use of the Irish language, and to support the sustainable development of the islands.

            The Department funds a number of State Bodies and Agencies with responsibilities relating to various
            aspects of
            the Department’s remit and works with these bodies and agencies to ensure a co-ordinated approach to
            fulfilling
            the Department’s mandate.

            The Department is also a co-sponsor of two of the six cross-border implementation bodies established under
            the
            terms of the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.

            The Department has a gross voted allocation of almost €383m. in 2016. There are over 500 staff employed in
            the
            Department and 1,000 in the State Bodies operating under its aegis.
